==========

Zenmo Zero is a tool to simulate local energy systems.

This repository contains a web-based application to help bootstrap the Zenmo Zero simulation model with external data.

Works together with:

* [Zero Engine](https://github.com/Zenmo/zero_engine)
* [Zero Results UI](https://github.com/Zenmo/zero_results_UI)

Components
----------

### [Frontend](frontend)

Graphical user interface. The company survey form is here.

### [Kleinverbruik](kleinverbruik)

Stedin, Liander and Enexis publish usage data of natural gas and electricity anually.
This is a small webservice which wraps this data so the frontend can request small parts of the data.

### [Ztor](ztor)

This is the base backend built on Ktor framework. Like AnyLogic it leans on the Java ecosystem.

### [Zorm](zorm)

Object-relational mapper for the core domain. This is to store surveys of companies in 
modelled business parks.

This contains:

* database schema definition
* mapping to Java data transfer objects
* create, read, update and delete methods

### [Migrations](migrations)

This contains database migrations for PostgreSQL.
This intends to include ALL tables used by the web application and data import tools.

The SQL schema is generated by the Ktor application.
The migrations are created manually by diffing the generated schema with the previous version. Datagrip or pgAdmin can help create such a diff.

The migrations are applied by Flyway.

### [EP Online](ep-online)

This is a script to import the national dataset of energielabels to a PostgreSQL database.
